## What are authentication and authorization? Which must come first?

### Authentication
The short explanation of authentication is that it is the process of verifying that, for instance, a user of a computer system is who he/she claims to be. In Spring Security, the authentication process consists of the following steps quoted from the Spring Security reference:
- The username and password are obtained and combined into an instance of `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` (an instance of the Authentication interface).
- The token is passed to an instance of `AuthenticationManager` for validation.
- The `AuthenticationManager` returns a fully populated Authentication instance on successful authentication.
- The security context is established by calling SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(...), passing in the returned authentication object.

### Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining that a user is permitted to do something that the user is attempting to do. Authorization is the process of specifying access rights to resources. Authorization typically involves the following two separate aspects that combine to describe the accessibility of the secured system:
- The first is the mapping of an authenticated principal to one or more authorities (often called roles); 
- The second is the assignment of authority checks to secured resources of the system.

### Which must come first?

Unless there is some type of authorization that specifies what resources and/or functions that can be accessed by anonymous users, authentication must always come before authorization.

## Is security a cross cutting concern? How is it implemented internally?

Short answer: Yes, security is a cross cutting concern.
Security is a function of an application that is not immediately associated with the business logic of the application – it is a secondary or supporting function.
How is it implemented internally?
- Using a Spring AOP proxy that inherits from the `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` class. Applied to method invocation authorization on objects secured with Spring Security.
- Spring Security’s web infrastructure is based entirely on servlet filters.

The following figure shows an overview of the Spring Security web infrastructure:

![Spring security web infrastructure overview](../assets/images/Spring%20Security%20web%20infra.jpg)

First of all a servlet filter of the type `DelegatingFilterProxy` is configured. The `DelegatingFilterProxy` delegates to a `FilterChainProxy`. The `FilterChainProxy` is defined as a Spring bean and takes one or more `SecurityFilterChain` instances as constructor parameter(s). A `SecurityFilterChain` associates a request URL pattern with a list of (security) filters.

| **Component Type** | **Function**  |
| ---------- | --- |
| `SecurityContextHolder` | Contains and provides access to the SecurityContext of the application. Default behavior is to associate the SecurityContext with the current thread. |
| `SecurityContext`| Default and only implementation in Spring Security holds an Authentication object. May also hold additional request-specific information. |
| `Authentication` | Represents token for authentication request or authenticated principal after the request has been granted. Also contains the authorities in the application that an authenticated principal has been granted. |
| `GrantedAuthority` | Represents an authority granted to an authenticated principal|
| `UserDetails` | Holds user information, such as user-name, password and authorities of the user. This information is used to create an Authentication object on successful authentication. May be extended to contain application-specific user information. |
| `UserDetailsService` | Given a user-name this service retrieves information about the user in a UserDetails object. Depending on the implementation of the user details service used, the information may be stored in a database, in memory or else where if a custom implementation is used. |

## What is the delegating filter proxy?

The `o.s.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy` class implements the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface and thus is a servlet filter. `DelegatingFilterProxy` is a special servlet filter that, by itself, doesn’t do much. Instead, it delegates all work to a Spring bean from the `ApplicationContext` root, which must implement `javax.servlet.Filter`. Since by default the bean is looked up by name, using the <filter-name> value, we must ensure we use springSecurityFilterChain as the value of <filter- name>. The pseudocode for how `o.s.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy` works for our web.xml file can be found in the following code snippet:

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>springSecurityFilterChain</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>
</filter>
```

```java
public class DelegatingFilterProxy implements Filter {
    void doFilter(request, response, filterChain) {
        Filter delegate = applicationContext.getBean("springSecurityFilterChain");
        delegate.doFilter(request, response, filterChain);
    }
}
```

## What is the security filter chain?

The security filter chain implements the `SecurityFilterChain` interface and the only implementation provided by Spring Security is the `DefaultSecurityFilterChain` class. The constructor of the `DefaultSecurityFilterChain` class takes a variable number of parameters, the first always being a request matcher. The remaining parameters are all filters which implements the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface. The order of the filters in a security filter chain is important – filters must be declared in the following order (filters may be omitted if not needed):

- ChannelProcessingFilter
- SecurityContextPersistenceFilter
- ConcurrentSessionFilter
- Any authentication filter. Such as UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter, CasAuthenticationFilter, BasicAuthenticationFilter
- SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter
- JaasApiIntegrationFilter
- RememberMeAuthenticationFilter
- AnonymousAuthenticationFilter
- ExceptionTranslationFilter
- FilterSecurityInterceptor

## What is a security context?

The most fundamental object is `SecurityContextHolder`. This is where we store details of the present security context of the application, which includes details of the principal currently using the application. By default the `SecurityContextHolder` uses a `ThreadLocal` to store these details, which means that the security context is always available to methods in the same thread of execution, even if the security context is not explicitly passed around as an argument to those methods. SecurityContextHolder.getContext().
The object returned by the call to `getContext()` is an instance of the `SecurityContext` interface. Taking a look at the `SecurityContext` interface, which defines the minimum security information associated with a thread of execution, there are two methods; one for setting and one for retrieving an object that implements the `Authentication` interface.
The Authentication interface defines the properties of an object that represents a security token for:
- A collection of the authorities granted to the principal
- The credentials used to authenticate a user. This can be a login name and a password that has
been verified to match
- Details Additional information, may be application specific or null if not used.
- Principal
- Authenticated flag A boolean indicating whether the principal has been successfully authenticated

`UserDetails` is not used for security purposes, it is just a "user info" bean. Spring Security uses `Authentication` instances. So `Authentication` instance will usually have only the information needed to let users log in (usernames, credentials and roles, basically). `UserDetails` is more generic, and **can include anything related to user management** (such as contact information, account information, photographs, whatever).
Typically, you will have an **Authentication instance backed by a UserDetails instance.**

## What does the ** pattern in an antMatcher or mvcMatcher do?


? matches a single character.  
\* matches zero or more characters, excluding /.  
** matches zero or more directories in a patch.

The pattern "/events/**" matches "/events", "/events/",  
"/events/1", and "/events/1/form?test=1"; it does not  
match "/events123".  
The pattern "/events*" matches "/events", and "/events123";
it does not match "/events/" or "/events/1".  
The pattern "/events*/**", "/events123/456", and "/events/1/form?test=1".

There are two wildcards that can be used in URL patterns:
  - `*` matches any path on the level at which the wildcard occur. Example: /services/* matches /services/users and /services/orders but not /services/orders/123/items.
  - `**` matches any path on the level at the wildcard occurs and all levels below. If only /** or ** then will match any request. Example: /services/** matches /services, /services/, / services/users and /services/orders and also /services/orders/123/items etc.

## Why is the usage of mvcMatcher recommended over antMatcher?

As an example antMatchers("/services") only matches the exact “/services” URL while mvcMatchers("/services") matches “/services” but also “/services/”, “/services.html” and “/services.abc”. Thus the mvcMatcher matches more than the antMatcher and is more forgiving as far as configuration mistakes are concerned. In addition, the mvcMatchers API uses the same matching rules as used by the `@RequestMapping` annotation. Finally, the mvcMatchers API is newer than the antMatchers API.

## Does Spring Security support password encoding?

Spring Security supports password encoding. Spring Security’s **PasswordEncoder** interface is used to perform a one way transformation of a password to allow the password to be stored securely.
`PasswordEncoderFactories` has one method:
static PasswordEncoder createDelegatingPasswordEncoder() Creates a DelegatingPasswordEncoder with default mappings.

## Why do you need method security? What type of object is typically secured at the method level (think of its purpose not its Java type).

So far mainly the part of Spring Security that supplies security for web resources, accomplished using servlet filters, has been discussed. Spring Security also has support for security on method level with which security constraints can be applied to individual methods in Spring beans.
Security on the method level needs to be explicitly enabled using the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation in regular Spring applications.
Method security is an additional level of security in web applications but can also be the only layer of security in applications that do not expose a web interface.
By securing both the web layer of your application and the methods behind the scenes, you can be sure that no logic will be executed unless the user is authorized.
Method-level security is commonly applied to services in the service layer of an application.

## What do @PreAuthorized and @RolesAllowed do? What is the difference between them?

- Spring Security’s own `@Secured`
- JSR-250’s `@RolesAllowed`
- Expression-driven annotations, with `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, `@PreFilter` and `@PostFilter`

The `@Secured` and `@RolesAllowed` annotations are the simplest options, restricting access based on what authorities have been granted to the user.

### PreAuthorize

The `@PreAuthorize` annotation allows for specifying access constraints to a method using the Spring Expression Language (SpEL). These constraints are evaluated prior to the method being executed and may result in execution of the method being denied if the constraints are not fulfilled. The @PreAuthorize annotation is part of the Spring Security framework.
In order to be able to use `@PreAuthorize`, the prePostEnabled attribute in the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation needs to be set to true.

```java
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled=true)
```

### Roles Allowed

The `@RolesAllowed` annotation has its origin in the JSR-250 Java security standard. This annotation is more limited than the `@PreAuthorize` annotation in that it only supports role- based security.
In order to use the `@RolesAllowed` annotation the library containing this annotation needs to be on the classpath, as it is not part of Spring Security. In addition, the jsr250Enabled attribute of the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation need to be set to true.

```java
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(jsr250Enabled=true)
```

## How are these annotations implemented?

Method-level security is accomplished using Spring AOP proxies.

## In which security annotation, are you allowed to use SpEL?

| Security Annotation | Has SpEL Support?  |
| ---------- | --- |
| `@PreAuthorize` | yes |
| `@PostAuthorize` | yes |
| `@PreFilter` | yes |
| `@PostFilter` | yes|
| `@Secured` | no |
| `@RolesAllowed` | no |
